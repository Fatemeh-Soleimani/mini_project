tic-tac-toe 
it's a game  for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
The players try to place their three pieces in a row in the stands and also prevent the opponent's pieces from being placed in a row.
